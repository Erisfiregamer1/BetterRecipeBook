# Better Recipe Book

Adds a few quality of life changes to the recipe book.

### Features

- Adds scrolling to the recipe book
    - Option for 'scrolling in circles' (I couldn't think of any other term). Like JEI, it will wrap back to the start when you reach the end. (And vice versa)
- Optionally unlock all recipes when you log in to a server/world.
  - This also suppresses the "Recipe Unlocked" toast when enabled
- Remove the "Bounce" animation when you unlock a new recipe.
- Show the item in the alternatives list instead of their recipe so its easy to see
